# c-linked-list

## Clone project

```
git clone https://github.com/Fakorede/c-linked-list
cd c-linked-list
```

## Running project

To build and run the project, execute the command below. It compiles the code using the gcc compiler, and generate an executable file which is then immediately ran:

```
make run
```

## Challenges

To attempt the challenge, I took a [C programming course](https://www.udemy.com/course/c-programming-for-beginners-/) to learn the advanced concepts used in the project such as Pointers, Structs and the C standard library.

I made reference to this [article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-linked-lists-work/) that explains in detail how a linked list works.

Makefile [tutorial](https://www.cs.colby.edu/maxwell/courses/tutorials/maketutor/) for compiling C code.
